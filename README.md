Mosquito dual fan cooler for the SK-GO

I spent a little time modelling up a new cooler for my SK-GO. I wasn't happen with the cooling ability of other coolers out there and how they would fit on the Slice Engineering Mosquito. So I designed something which should be fairly effective since it's twin fan. Initially prototypes show good cooling ability. I had to turn down cooling from 100% to 75% when printing PLA on mine as the bottom layers were being cooled too much.
